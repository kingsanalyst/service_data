THERE ARE TWO PARTS IN THIS PROJECT

Part 1

·        I used SQL Server:

·        for making a home for data

·        getting data in

Part2 

·        I used Power BI for visualizations

·        Linking Power Bi to MS SQL Server 


## Result/findings 

•	Europe region is generating the most revenue

•	Audit department generates the most revenue

•	Smith Inc. is our top client.

## Solution/recommendation

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions 

•	Marketing and promotion should be focused more on Europe region for more revenue generation 

•	Invest more in Audit department to maximize revenue

•	Smith Inc. Should be treated as important

## Limitations

I had to remove duplicates on the time band column, and also changed the data types which would have affected the accuracy of the conclusion from the analysis.
